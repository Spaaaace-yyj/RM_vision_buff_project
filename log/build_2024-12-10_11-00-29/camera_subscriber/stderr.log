[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findopencv4.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "opencv4", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "opencv4" with any
  of the following names:

    opencv4Config.cmake
    opencv4-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "opencv4" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "opencv4_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "opencv4" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
