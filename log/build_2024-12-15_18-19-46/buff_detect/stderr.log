[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findparameter_descriptor.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "parameter_descriptor", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "parameter_descriptor" with any of the following names:

    parameter_descriptorConfig.cmake
    parameter_descriptor-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "parameter_descriptor" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "parameter_descriptor_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "parameter_descriptor" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
